# Configuring a userâ€™s VM Inbox Language

This blueprint is a solution for idea AMUGM-I-76 (https://genesyscloud.ideas.aha.io/ideas/AMUGM-I-76). This blueprint addresses the need to configure voicemail inbox language per user profile, rather than system-wide. This is particularly useful for environments with multilingual users, such as English and French speakers.

We can configure per user based on their division or if they have a primary number, we can do it by the international dialling code. This will only work if TTS is available for that language.
